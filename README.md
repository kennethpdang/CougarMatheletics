# CougarMatheletics Website
This is a Next.js project for your CougarMatheletics club at the University of Houston.
It uses firebase as backend and Next JS and React JS as front - end.

The file hierarchy looks like:
```
üìÅ Components
üìÅ Public
```

**The uses of each folder:** \
Components: To create re-usable components, such as the navbar and other things. \
Library: For custom react JS hooks and for backend information and tokens (perhaps MongoDB or Firebase). \
Pages: Each URL route of the application goes here. \
Public: For Favicons, Icons, Logos, other images (background images and banners). \
Styles: For both specific page cascading style sheets and general cascading style sheets.
